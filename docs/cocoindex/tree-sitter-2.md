# Can you provide me with a list of available tree-sitter (grammars) that are _not_ incooperated in cocoindex?

As of July 2025, the **full and current list of available Tree-sitter grammars** is maintained on the official [Tree-sitter Wiki "List of parsers"](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/wiki/List-of-parsers)[^1_4]. However, your request is specifically for a list of grammars that are **not incorporated in "cocoindex"**.

Since the provided search results do not contain a listing of the grammars incorporated by "cocoindex", nor do they directly offer a list of grammars that are specifically *excluded* from cocoindex, a direct and fully authoritative answer cannot be given from the results alone.

However, based on the context:

- **Tree-sitter grammars** are continuously being developed by the community; new ones include modern or less-popular languages which may not yet be integrated into tooling platforms or indexes like "cocoindex"[^1_4][^1_10].
- For example, grammars like **Gleam** are explicitly mentioned as "not packaged" or supported in multiple places, such as Nixpkgs, and are described as "quite a few newer languages" that are missing from most mainline distributions[^1_10][^1_5].
- **Fusion** (for the Neos CMS) is another example, with a dedicated Tree-sitter grammar that is not standard in leading editor integrations and, by extension, is unlikely to be present in more curated indexes like cocoindex unless recently added[^1_3].
- There are also grammars for very niche domains or with less maintenance that might not be picked up by more centralized projects or indexes—for instance, languages currently considered experimental or forks patched for special environments[^1_4].

If you want a **precise list**, you can:

1. Compare the [official Tree-sitter Wiki "List of parsers"](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/wiki/List-of-parsers) with the "cocoindex" list of supported grammars[^1_4].
2. Subtract the grammars present in "cocoindex" from the official Tree-sitter list.
3. Any grammar present on the official Tree-sitter list but *not* in the "cocoindex" list would fit your criteria.

### Examples of Tree-sitter grammars likely **not included in cocoindex** (based on their newness or niche status):

- **Gleam**[^1_5][^1_10]
- **Fusion**[^1_3]
- **Lalrpop**[^1_4]
- **Ledger**[^1_4]
- Very new or community-driven grammars listed on the Tree-sitter Wiki but not in mainstream package collections[^1_4][^1_10].

If you have access to the "cocoindex" list, performing a programmatic or manual diff against the [Tree-sitter Wiki list][^1_4] will give you an exhaustive answer.

**In summary:**
You can identify Tree-sitter grammars not incorporated in cocoindex by comparing the project’s supported grammars to the official Tree-sitter grammar list. Gleam, Fusion, and other recently registered or niche grammars are examples likely missing from established aggregators like cocoindex as of July 2025[^1_3][^1_4][^1_10].

# Can you provide the link to cocoindex list of supported grammars?

Based on the provided search results, there is **no direct link to a dedicated CocoIndex list of supported grammars** included in the context. The only information referencing CocoIndex details a changelog and some infrastructure updates, but it does not provide or point to a page or resource where you can view their supported grammars list[^2_3].

If you need this information, you should visit the official CocoIndex website or documentation and look for a section about supported languages or grammars. If such a list exists, it would typically be found in a section labeled "supported languages," "grammars," or similar within their main site or documentation.

# How does the cocoindex flow support incremental file updates? How to use that? Show me some code!

**CocoIndex** supports **incremental file updates** by automatically tracking which parts of your source data have changed and only recomputing or updating the corresponding elements in your index, rather than reprocessing everything. This is handled internally via data lineage tracking and a computation cache[^3_1][^3_2][^3_4][^3_5].

### How incremental updates work

- **Detects updates**: CocoIndex monitors your data source for changes, either periodically (using a refresh interval) or through change notifications and recent-changes polling (for sources like Google Drive)[^3_3][^3_4].
- **Minimizes computation**: Only parts of the data pipeline affected by the changes are recomputed; cached results for unchanged data are reused.
- **Handles data lineage**: Maintains mapping from source data to index rows so that changed or deleted elements are managed automatically―no stale data left[^3_1][^3_4].


### How to use incremental updates

You do not need to implement low-level incremental logic yourself; **just define your ETL transformation as normal**. CocoIndex will automatically apply incremental processing on each run[^3_1][^3_2][^3_4][^3_5].

There are **two ways to run incremental updates**:

- **Batch mode**: One-time index update that efficiently processes only new/changed data.
- **Live update mode**: Runs a long-lived watcher for continuous real-time update, synchronizing your index to source changes with low latency.


### Example: Live update mode with code

Using the Python SDK, here's how you might set up an incremental live update from a Google Drive source:

```python
import cocoindex
import datetime

flow_builder = cocoindex.FlowBuilder()

# Add a source with change data capture enabled
data_scope = {}
data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.add_source(
    cocoindex.sources.GoogleDrive(
        recent_changes_poll_interval=datetime.timedelta(seconds=10),
        refresh_interval=datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)
    )
)

# Build the flow as usual (e.g., transformations)
# flow_builder.add_transformation(...)

# Run the updater in live mode
updater = cocoindex.FlowLiveUpdater(flow_builder)
updater.run()
```

Or use the CLI:

```sh
cocoindex update -L
```

Where `-L` enables live incremental updates[^3_2][^3_3][^3_4].

**No custom incremental code is needed**; CocoIndex transparently manages the file updates, tracks lineage, and reuses cached computations, ensuring that reprocessing is minimal and efficient[^3_1][^3_2][^3_4].

For more real-world code, see the [official CocoIndex repository](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex)[^3_5].

# If using cocoindex as a basic for a code RAG, what specific interface/endpoints should be implemented?

To use **CocoIndex** as the foundation for a code RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, you need to expose endpoints or interfaces that allow:

- **Index configuration and update** – ingesting and transforming code data incrementally.
- **Querying the index** – retrieving results (typically code snippets and embeddings) for RAG integration.


### Essential Interfaces/Endpoints

An index-as-a-service or RAG-as-a-service model with CocoIndex typically requires two main endpoints[^4_2]:

1. **Source Configuration Endpoint**
    - Allows users to specify or upload code/project sources to be indexed.
    - Configure parsing, chunking, and embedding strategies suitable for code (for example, selects the correct parser, chunking at function or class boundaries, and sets the embedding model).
    - Example endpoint: `POST /sources` (with project details and configuration) or as part of a pipeline YAML/JSON.
2. **Query Endpoint**
    - Exposes search or retrieval functionality against the indexed codebase.
    - Accepts user queries and returns relevant code snippets, embeddings, and related metadata.
    - Example endpoint: `POST /search` with a payload like `{ "query": "...", "top_k": 5 }`.

### How to Implement with CocoIndex

CocoIndex itself is a Python library and CLI, so to expose API endpoints you typically:

- Build a Python server (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) that wraps your CocoIndex flow.
- The server should:
    - Accept configuration via an endpoint, and instantiate/update CocoIndex flows as needed.
    - Provide a query API that, for a given user query, retrieves relevant index rows from your target vector DB (like Qdrant), and returns the results for RAG.

**CocoIndex integration code sample:**

```python
import cocoindex

# Define or load your code indexing flow (with chunking/parsing/embedding logic)
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="CodeRAGFlow")
def code_rag_flow(flow_builder, data_scope):
    # ... define sources, transformations, and export here ...
    pass

flow = code_rag_flow()

# Update/build index (batch or live)
flow.update() # One-time batch update

# Or run live (for incremental updates)
with cocoindex.FlowLiveUpdater(flow) as updater:
    # Your REST API (e.g. with FastAPI) can now hook into the updated index
    pass

# In your API endpoint for query:
def query_index(query_text, top_k=5):
    # This function would interface with your vector DB
    # (for example, using Qdrant's search API)
    embeddings = embed_query(query_text) # Embed using the model from your flow
    results = vector_db.search(embeddings, top_k=top_k)
    return results
```


### Notes and Recommendations

- **Index configuration:** You may want to expose a "reload" or "reconfigure" endpoint that triggers flow setup or updates, reflecting new repositories or updated transformation logic.
- **Querying:** Should be designed for low-latency access, possibly with hybrid search—vector similarity and text filtering (like file path or language).
- **Incremental update:** CocoIndex handles incremental flow updates automatically; invoke `.update()` or use `FlowLiveUpdater` for live sync[^4_3].


### References to Official Docs

- [CocoIndex pipeline customization and interfaces](https://cocoindex.io/blogs/data-indexing-custom-logic)[^4_2]
- [Flow operations and programmatic usage, including batch and live update](https://cocoindex.io/docs/core/flow_methods)[^4_3]
- [Example of vector DB integration (Qdrant)](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/data-management/cocoindex/)[^4_1]

You don't need to implement custom incremental tracking or deduplication in your API; that’s part of what CocoIndex provides out-of-the-box for your file/code sources. For complete RAG service, your application/API will wrap CocoIndex for indexing and DB retrieval.

# In cocoindex there is the example examples/code_embedding . It let you search on the index code. I think it is based on pgvector (postgresql db)  Is there a special search syntax? Would the search change it QDrant would be used? Could I support several search endpoint, e.g. one for finding the function/implementation, one for usages/crossreference? How the db must support that?

The **`examples/code_embedding`** example in **cocoindex** demonstrates searching indexed code using a vector database, and by default it supports **pgvector** (PostgreSQL extension) for vector similarity search. Here's how the search capabilities and syntax work, how they could change with Qdrant, and considerations for supporting specialized endpoints such as function or usage/cross-reference search:

### Search Syntax with pgvector

- **Searches** are performed using *vector similarity operators* in SQL.
- Common operators include:
    - `<->` for **Euclidean distance** similarity search
    - `<#>` for **inner product** similarity search
    - `<=>` for **cosine similarity** search
- Example (Python/SQL):

```sql
SELECT title, content
FROM document_embeddings
WHERE embedding <-> '[your_query_embedding]' < threshold;
```

- You can combine vector similarity with other filters or conditions, and also use hybrid searches (e.g., combining semantic search with keyword filters)[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3][^5_4].
- **pgvector** allows hybrid and complex queries thanks to Postgres' flexibility, including filtering by metadata, file path, symbol name, etc.


### Switching to Qdrant

- **Qdrant** uses a different API: instead of SQL, it exposes a REST/gRPC API (and Python SDK) for similarity search.
- The search request is made by sending an **embedding vector** and any filters/conditions as parameters.
- The general search logic (retrieve top-k vectors similar to the query embedding, with optional metadata filters) remains the same as with pgvector, but the syntax is different (not SQL).
- In cocoindex, **only the backend/storage adapter needs to change**. Your application abstracts away most of the difference; you call an API, not hand-write SQL.


### Supporting Multiple Specialized Search Endpoints

You absolutely can (and often should) implement **specialized endpoints**:

- **Find function/implementation**:
Design your endpoint to:
    - Filter index entries by type (e.g., only "function" nodes).
    - Perform vector search on these filtered results.
- **Find usages/cross-reference**:
    - Use the symbol references indexed alongside each code chunk.
    - Endpoint returns all code blocks referencing the given function/symbol.


#### Example: API design

| Endpoint | Description | DB/Index Requirement |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/search/nearest` | Standard top-k vector similarity search | Vectors + metadata |
| `/search/function` | Filter by type=function and nearest search | Store type info in metadata, allow filtering |
| `/search/usage` | Find references/usages of a given symbol | Symbol cross-refs must be indexed and filterable |

**Your DB schema or index must**:

- Store **necessary metadata** (e.g., type: function/class, file path, symbol name, reference targets) as vector payload or metadata fields.
- Support **hybrid filtering/search**: vector distance plus attribute filter (both pgvector + Postgres and Qdrant do this; in Qdrant, it's filters; in Postgres, it's SQL WHERE).
- **Qdrant**:
    - Store metadata in its payload field for each point.
    - Use filtering in the search requests.
- **Pgvector**:
    - Store metadata in table columns.
    - Use SQL WHERE clauses for filtering before or after vector search.


### Summary Table

| Feature | pgvector (Postgres) | Qdrant |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Search Syntax | SQL operators (`<->`, `<=>`, etc.) | REST/gRPC API / Python SDK |
| Filtering | SQL WHERE (on metadata columns) | Filter param (on payload) |
| Hybrid Search | Full flexibility of SQL | Yes, with filter + query |
| Specialized Endpoints | Easily supported via queries | Easily supported via filters |
| Cross-reference/Usage Search | Needs indexed metadata/links | Needs indexed metadata/links |

**In conclusion:**

- Both **pgvector** and **Qdrant** can support advanced and specialized code search endpoints, provided you index the necessary metadata.
- The actual *syntax* for similarity and hybrid search will differ: SQL for pgvector/Postgres, API/filter structure for Qdrant―but the overall capabilities are equivalent.
- Supporting different endpoints (e.g., for function finding vs. usages) just requires storing/structuring your index with the right metadata and referencing fields, and using your DB's filtering features in vector queries[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3][^5_4].
