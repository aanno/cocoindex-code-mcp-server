# How I use tree-sitter in cocoindex?

To use **Tree-sitter** in **CocoIndex**, you leverage its built-in integration to parse and chunk your codebase in a syntax-aware way, improving the quality of code indexing for tasks like RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), semantic search, and code navigation[^1_1][^1_4][^1_6].

Here’s a concise guide:

1. **Extract the file extension**
Tree-sitter requires the language to be specified (detected via file extension). In CocoIndex, define a function to extract it while processing each file:

```python
@cocoindex.op.function()
def extract_extension(filename: str) -> str:
    """Extract the extension of a filename."""
    return os.path.splitext(filename)
```

Then apply it:

```python
with data_scope["files"].row() as file:
    file["extension"] = file["filename"].transform(extract_extension)
```

This stores the extension (like `.py`, `.rs`, etc.) in a field for each file[^1_1][^1_4].
2. **Chunk the code using Tree-sitter**
Use the `SplitRecursively` function. This function integrates with Tree-sitter and respects language boundaries. You pass the file's extension/language, and optionally chunk size and overlap:

```python
with data_scope["files"].row() as file:
    file["chunks"] = file["content"].transform(
        cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
        language=file["extension"],
        chunk_size=1000,      # adjust as needed
        chunk_overlap=300     # adjust as needed
    )
```

This gives you **syntax-aware code chunks**—not arbitrary line breaks, but functionally meaningful segments[^1_1][^1_4].
3. **Supported languages \& details**
    - Tree-sitter in CocoIndex supports most mainstream languages: Python, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and more.
    - If no language is specified or it’s not supported, CocoIndex will default to plain text chunking[^1_1][^1_4][^1_6].

**Summary:**

- Extract the file extension.
- Use `SplitRecursively` with the extension as the language: it calls Tree-sitter under the hood, which parses and chunks code semantically.

This workflow handles real-time incremental indexing—making it efficient for live codebases and AI integrations[^1_1].

For practical examples, see official CocoIndex tutorials or the blog post on this process[^1_1][^1_4][^1_6].

# Is there support in tree-sitter of cocoindex for Haskell, go, rust and kotlin?

**Tree-sitter** in CocoIndex supports chunking and parsing for **Haskell**, **Go**, **Rust**, and **Kotlin**.

- **Haskell:** There is an official [tree-sitter-haskell](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-haskell) grammar, and CocoIndex's Tree-sitter integration can handle it[^2_3][^2_6]. While highlighting and type inference may be imperfect due to Haskell's complexity[^2_2], syntactic chunking and parsing are supported.
- **Go:** Tree-sitter has robust support for Go, and CocoIndex includes Go in its list of supported languages for semantic chunking via Tree-sitter[^2_1].
- **Rust:** Full support; Tree-sitter's Rust parser is well-established and natively integrated with CocoIndex[^2_1].
- **Kotlin:** Tree-sitter includes a Kotlin parser, and CocoIndex’s Tree-sitter integration supports it for code chunking and syntax tree extraction[^2_1].

You can verify and view the currently supported languages by inspecting the source code of CocoIndex, particularly the language support map in the SplitRecursively function[^2_4]. All four languages—**Haskell, Go, Rust, and Kotlin**—are included in CocoIndex’s Tree-sitter support for semantic code chunking and indexing.

# Ok, what has to be done for including the tree-sitter-haskell grammar with cocoindex?

To include the **tree-sitter-haskell** grammar with **CocoIndex**, you need to ensure two things: **the parser is built and available as a dynamic library on your system, and CocoIndex is configured to load it when processing Haskell files**.

Here’s what you need to do:

**1. Clone and build the tree-sitter-haskell parser**

- Clone the [tree-sitter-haskell repo][^3_1] to your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-haskell.git
cd tree-sitter-haskell
```

- Generate the parser code and build the dynamic library:

```sh
tree-sitter generate --build
```

    - This should produce a shared object file (e.g., `haskell.so` or `tree-sitter-haskell.so`) in `.lib/` or in your working directory[^3_1].
    - If you need a WebAssembly build (for environments like the browser or WASM runtimes), follow:

```sh
tree-sitter build --wasm
```

- Move or symlink the `.so` file to a directory where CocoIndex or your Tree-sitter runtime can find it (often in a `parsers/` or `vendor/` directory, or wherever your Tree-sitter-based code expects to discover language grammars).

**2. Ensure CocoIndex can find the Haskell grammar**

- CocoIndex typically relies on Tree-sitter’s language loader to find grammars based on file extension mappings. Make sure your `cocoindex` pipeline references `.hs` files (or whichever Haskell extension you use).
- If CocoIndex supports dynamic loading, and you’ve built and placed the `.so` as above, it should auto-detect Haskell files and use the grammar.

**3. (Optional) Register or configure the language in CocoIndex**

- If CocoIndex requires explicit language registration or a mapping update, add or ensure an entry for Haskell is present, linking the `.hs` extension to your shared library.

**Summary steps:**

- Build `tree-sitter-haskell` using `tree-sitter generate --build`[^3_1].
- Ensure the resulting `.so` is accessible to your CocoIndex setup.
- Configure CocoIndex (if necessary) to map Haskell file extensions to the Tree-sitter Haskell parser.

> After these steps, CocoIndex should be able to parse and chunk Haskell code using Tree-sitter’s grammar, enabling semantic indexing and code retrieval workflows.

# tree-sitter could be used for incremental parsing in near RT. Is that supported with cocoindex somehow?

**Tree-sitter** itself is an incremental parsing library, specifically designed for near real-time applications[^4_3][^4_4][^4_5][^4_9]. **CocoIndex leverages Tree-sitter for code chunking and syntax tree extraction, and it supports near real-time incremental indexing.**

Here's how this is realized in CocoIndex:

- **Incremental Indexing:**
CocoIndex's indexing pipeline is built with incremental processing in mind—it only reprocesses files (or even file segments) that have changed, rather than re-indexing the entire codebase each time. This allows updates to the index in near real-time, especially when connected to sources that provide change notifications (such as code editor plugins)[^4_1].
- **Tree-sitter Integration:**
When chunking code, CocoIndex uses Tree-sitter's parser for efficient, syntax-aware segmentation, which naturally benefits from Tree-sitter's incremental capabilities. This ensures that only the affected parts of the parse tree (and thus the code index) are updated upon changes, rather than re-parsing entire files needlessly[^4_1][^4_2].
- **Practical Impact:**
CocoIndex can provide near real-time code search, RAG, and AI code-assistant features, because the incremental updates keep the code index always current with minimal latency[^4_1].

**Summary:**
While CocoIndex does not expose the lower-level Tree-sitter incremental parsing API directly, its **native integration and real-time updating mechanisms use the incremental processing advantages of Tree-sitter under the hood**. This enables efficient, prompt updates to the code index in response to live codebase changes without requiring full reprocessing[^4_1][^4_2].

# What to do in cocoindex code for increamental processing with tree-sitter?

**CocoIndex** is designed as a dataflow engine where **incremental processing is a first-class feature**[^5_1][^5_4][^5_5]. Incremental parsing (as enabled by Tree-sitter) means only changed files or segments are re-parsed and re-indexed, minimizing reprocessing when source code is modified[^5_1][^5_2][^5_5]. Here is what you need to do in CocoIndex code to benefit from incremental processing with Tree-sitter:

### 1. **Organize Your Pipeline as Data Transformations**

CocoIndex operates like a spreadsheet: every output field is **traceable to its inputs and operations**, so when any file or chunk of code changes, dependent transformations are automatically updated just for the affected parts[^5_1][^5_5].

### 2. **Use the Built-in Tree-sitter Integration**

Leverage the `SplitRecursively` operation in your dataflow pipeline, specifying the language for Tree-sitter to use:

```python
with data_scope["files"].row() as file:
    file["chunks"] = file["content"].transform(
        cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
        language=file["extension"], 
        chunk_size=1000, 
        chunk_overlap=300
    )
```

This chunks code **semantically** using Tree-sitter's parser, which is designed for incremental parsing[^5_2][^5_3][^5_6][^5_7]. CocoIndex will call this transformation **only for new or changed content**[^5_1][^5_5].

### 3. **Allow the Engine to Track Lineage and Changes**

- **Lineage Tracking:** Every transformation's output is connected to its inputs — the engine tracks which outputs depend on which inputs[^5_1][^5_5].
- **Automatic Propagation:** Once the content in a source file changes, **CocoIndex updates only the downstream data derived from that file** — not the entire index[^5_1][^5_5].
- **Efficient Re-embedding:** If you use chunk embeddings, only updated chunks are re-embedded and re-indexed[^5_2].


### 4. **No Manual Triggers Needed**

Incremental updates happen automatically as part of CocoIndex’s architecture — you do **not** need to manually tell the system what changed. Organize your steps clearly, and CocoIndex's incremental engine will handle the rest based on input changes.

**Summary Table:** What You Do vs. What CocoIndex Does


| What You Do (in code) | What CocoIndex Does (engine behavior) |
| :-- | :-- |
| Write dataflow pipeline using `transform` and `SplitRecursively` | Tracks lineage and dependencies per transformation |
| Organize file reading/chunking as steps in the data pipeline | Detects exactly which files/chunks changed |
| Use extension as 'language' so Tree-sitter parser invoked | Applies Tree-sitter for syntax-aware incremental parse |
| Optionally, add embedding/export steps after chunking | Only processes/exports newly changed or affected chunks |

**Key Point:**
> *“Once value of a source cell changes, we automatically update derived cell values based on formulas with minimum reprocessing... This lineage model enables features like incremental processing, intelligent caching, and transformation-level explainability, all out of the box.”*[^5_1][^5_5]

**In essence:**
Structure your data pipeline in CocoIndex using standard operations and Tree-sitter-based chunking. The engine automatically handles incremental processing — only updating chunks/files and downstream outputs that have actually changed[^5_1][^5_4][^5_5].
