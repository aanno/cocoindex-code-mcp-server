# Backlog TODOs

* yml is not supported because of `eval_CodeEmbedding_*`
  from `cocoindex evaluate` will trash the scanning (recursion problem?)
* smart embedding is currently disabled
* logic for PYTHON_HANDLER_AVAILABLE is not implemented
* AST Visitor in rust
* Use AST Visitor everywhere
* Reactivate skip tests
* Implement haskell support in parity with python
  (improve chunking, check embedding, implement own metadata extractor)
* Graph support (for GraphRAG)
